This site is to share tips, knowledge and thoughts to whom is interested. I'm not tired to learn and I think 24 hours is not enough in a day to do all I want to do.

I have special interests in Self Sovereign Identity, Customer Identity and Access Management, Quantum Computing, AI, Low code but not only...

I'm working in Nyon (Switzerland) as Solution Architect for the same company since 1996: [Atos] [Atos-link] (previously CTP Switzerland, Novell, CTP see the story [here] [CTP-wiki])
